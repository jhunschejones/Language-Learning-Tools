# Sentences From Deck

### Overview
A quick and dirty Ruby script to gather example sentences from text exports of my main Anki study deck. There is not much abstraction here and depending on how often I need to use this I may not develop it any further. Feel free to take this code and modify it to match your own deck formatting if it will help you!

### In Use
1. Do a text export of the _cards_ in the main study deck and place the file in `/decks`
2. Make sure the file name referenced at the top of the script matches the new exported file
3. Run `ruby main.rb`
