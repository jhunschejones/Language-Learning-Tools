# Loud Enough

### Overview
A simple CLI script to make normalizing volume with `ffmpg` easy to do on the fly! Drag and drop `.mp3`, `.mp4` or `.WAV.` files into the terminal and a normalized, `.mp3` version will be created and placed in `./processed`.

### In use
1. `brew install ffmpeg`
2. `./bin/run`

To clear out processed files, `./bin/clear-processed` will remove all `.mp3` files from the local processed folder.
