# Episode Namer

### Overview
A couple quick scripts to bulk clean up TV show files. The first removes or replaces text in a directory of `.mkv` files to help make renaming show episodes easier. The second script names `.srt` files to match the `.mkv` files in a directory.

### In use
Both scripts offer simple CLI prompts to work through a directory of files:
* Renaming: `ruby episode_rename.rb`
* Subtitle cleanup: `ruby subtitle_cleanup.rb`
