# Language Learning Tools

This repository holds scripts I've used or am currently using for Japanese language learning. Many of these tools were first created in my general [Ruby Scripts](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Scripts) repo, but I've extracted them here to provide a more focused collection for myself and others.

## Key Contents
* [`kanji_list`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Language-Learning-Tools/tree/main/kanji_list): A character tracking script for learning Japanese kanji
* [`media_formatter`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Language-Learning-Tools/tree/main/media_formatter): An image and audio file optimization and file-watcher script to speed up my language learning flashcard creation process
* [`japanese_to_audio`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Language-Learning-Tools/tree/main/japanese_to_audio): A script for transforming Japanese text into audio files using Amazon Polly
* [`sentences`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Language-Learning-Tools/tree/main/sentences): A script for storing and searching example sentences for Japanese language learning flashcards
* [`loud_enough`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Language-Learning-Tools/tree/main/loud_enough): A simpler version of the audio processor in `media_formatter`, allowing users to manually normalize audio files via the command line
* [`mpv_defaults`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Language-Learning-Tools/tree/main/): A script to speed up the setup process for using the mpv video player for language learning

You may notice additional tools in this repository that are not included in this list. I will do my best to keep this list up to date, but one-off scripts and the like may never make the main list. Feel free to poke around and see if there's anything here that can help in your own language learning journey! ðŸŽ‰
