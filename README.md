# Language Learning Tools

This repository holds scripts I've used or am currently using for Japanese language learning. Some of these tools were first created in my general [Ruby Scripts](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Scripts) repo, but I've extracted them here to provide a more focused collection for myself and others.

## Main Contents
* [`kanji_list`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Language-Learning-Tools/tree/main/kanji_list): A character extraction and tracking script for learning Japanese kanji
* [`media_formatter`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Language-Learning-Tools/tree/main/media_formatter): An image and audio file optimization and file-watcher script to speed up my language learning flashcard creation process
* [`japanese_to_audio`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Language-Learning-Tools/tree/main/japanese_to_audio): A script for transforming Japanese text into audio files using Amazon Polly
* [`loud_enough`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Language-Learning-Tools/tree/main/loud_enough): A simpler version of the audio processor in [`media_formatter`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Language-Learning-Tools/tree/main/media_formatter), allowing users to manually normalize audio files via the command line
* [`mpv_defaults`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Language-Learning-Tools/tree/main/mpv_defaults): A script to speed up the setup process for using the mpv video player for language learning
* [`anki_console`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Language-Learning-Tools/tree/main/anki_console): A Ruby console for running active record queries against an Anki sqlite database
* [`episode_renamer`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Language-Learning-Tools/tree/main/episode_renamer): A couple quick scripts to bulk clean up TV show files for immersion learning

You may see some additional tools in this repository that are not included in this list. I will do my best to keep this list up to date, but some one-off scripts may never make the main list. Feel free to poke around and see if there's anything here that can help in your own language learning journey! ðŸŽ‰
