# Language Learning Tools

This repository holds scripts I've used or am currently using for Japanese language learning. Many of these tools were first created in my general [Ruby Scripts](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Scripts) repo, but I've extracted them here to provide a more focused collection for myself and others.

## Key Contents
* [`kanji_list`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Scripts/tree/master/kanji_list): A character tracking script for learning Japanese kanji
* [`media_formatter`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Scripts/tree/master/media_formatter): An image and audio file optimization and file-watcher script to speed up my language learning flashcard creation process
* [`japanese_to_audio`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Scripts/tree/master/japanese_to_audio): A script for transforming Japanese text into audio files using Amazon Polly
* [`sentences`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Scripts/tree/master/sentences): A script for storing and searching example sentences for Japanese language learning flashcards

You may notice additional tools included here as well. I will do my best to keep this list up to date, but one-off scripts and the like they may not may never make the main list. Feel free to poke around and see if there's anything here that can help in your language learning journey! ðŸŽ‰
